A maze game to escape from a monster home

## Summary

This maze game is allowed the player to interact by using the keyboard up, down, left and right to control the little red square, from the entrance on the left to the exit on the right. The black in the game could stop the square from going through. I use rectangular to build up the letter and wall. 

## Component Parts
I coded square to represent the player and using black as the barrier to stop the player going forward. And the player could go around the barrier to win the game. For controlling the square, I used "keyboard" to control up, down, left and right on the computer keyboard by using number of "39""37""38""40" and x = x + speed; x = x - speed; y = y - speed; y = y + speed to make it has certain movement. To interact between keyboard and barrier, I used "if" function to stop red square go through the black wall. 

For making the game look more interesting, I added "random" in the rectangular to make it vibrate.

## Timeline

What did you do in each of the past four weeks?

- Week 0: Write Proposal
- Week 1:research how to make this map 
- Week 2:start writing the code of basic movement
- Week 3: add the map
- Week 4: Present!


## Challenges

I am thinking to add the line which is the function part of the maze, but it is hard for me to make that function like a wall which if my keyboard cannot go through the wall.
